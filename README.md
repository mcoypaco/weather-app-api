**Setup Instructions**:
- Clone the repository by ```git clone https://github.com/mcoypaco/weather-app-api.git```
- Go to the root directory and run ```composer install```
- Add ```WEATHER_API_KEY``` in the ```.env``` file and use the API Key from ```https://openweathermap.org```

**Why I think my UI/UX is the best?**

- I have used **Vuetify** ```https://vuetifyjs.com/en/``` as my component library.
- It follows Google's ```Material Design``` pattern which is a great platform design especially for mobile application and web apps.
- The application's design is responsive for mobile devices.
- Simplistic yet detailed.

**Note**

I may have not finished all the features for a robust weather app, but I'm still happy to show an output for this time pressure coding challenge. :smile:
